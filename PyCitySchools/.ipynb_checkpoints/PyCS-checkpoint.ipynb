    "# SUMMARY:\n",
    "  This script is used to analyse the school data of a local goverment area to helpp the school board and the mayor to make  decisions on budgets and priorities. The data are summarised as:\n",
    "  (1) for the whole local goverment area; then by \n",
    "  (2) schools; and their \n",
    "  (3) students performance based on their scores on maths, reading, and overall - per school and per year level;\n",

    "# TRENDS:\n",
    "  * One of the most apparent trends is we could see that the performance of the students are affected by the school size. As seen from the **size_summary** table, all the passing scores and the passing rates decrease as the school size becomes larger. A similar observation can be seen in the school type as well. Indpendent schools seem to have higher performing students than the ones in Goverment schools, which again can be attributed to the student population. **per_school_summary** table shows that Goverment schools have higher number of total students as compared to Independent schools.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * In terms of school spending, **spending_summary** table shows that the most optimal budget allocated per student is about S585-630 per student, spending more or less than this range actually shows a decrease in the students performance. Looking at the **per_school_summary** table, we can see that the Independent schools' budgets per student are well within this range. At the same time, it is also worth noting that the Government schools have higher budget per student than the Independent schools."
